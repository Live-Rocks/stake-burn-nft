MineMine NFT Staking Game

MineMine is an innovative NFT staking game platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, combining NFTs, tokens, and a deflationary mechanism to provide players with opportunities to earn rewards and participate in the token economy.

NFT Supply
Gold NFT Total Supply: 1,000
Silver NFT Total Supply: 1,500
Bronze NFT Total Supply: 2,500

$MMG Token
The platform will issue the $MMG token, which will be used for staking rewards and liquidity provision. The token allocation is as follows:

50% for staking rewards, distributed to players who stake their NFTs
50% for providing liquidity for $MMG, ensuring liquidity in the secondary market

Staking Rewards
Players can stake their NFTs into the MineMine contract. After meeting the minimum staking period of 7 days, they can claim $MMG token rewards:

Staking a Bronze NFT rewards 5 $MMG
Staking a Silver NFT rewards 25 $MMG
Staking a Gold NFT rewards 200 $MMG

NFT Burning and Deflation
Players can choose to permanently burn their Gold, Silver, or Bronze NFTs, and in return, they will receive a 0.01 ETH reward.

NFT burning not only rewards players with ETH but also promotes a deflationary mechanism within the MineMine ecosystem. Whenever an NFT is burned, the total supply of NFTs in the market decreases, increasing the scarcity and value of the remaining unburned NFTs.

Security and Transparency

The MineMine game contract utilizes the OpenZeppelin ERC1155 and ERC20 standards and incorporates the SafeMath library to prevent integer overflows and other security vulnerabilities. The contract code has been audited for security and reliability, ensuring transparent operations.

By combining NFT staking, token rewards, and a deflationary mechanism, MineMine offers players an innovative NFT gaming platform. Players can not only showcase their NFT collections but also earn token rewards and participate in the token economy. The MineMine game is set to launch soon, so stay tuned!
